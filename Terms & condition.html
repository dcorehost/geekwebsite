The system automatically generates a ticket number and sends the customer an e-mail acknowledging that a trouble ticket has been created. Keep in mind the following: Responses are provided during normal business hours. Timeframes represent a best effort; delays may occur when products must be ordered or vendors engaged. With equipment orders (e.g., laptops, smart phones), our staff is responsible for providing specs and quotes within the established response timeframe. The timing of equipment delivery is beyond our control. Problems may be resolved remotely. When computers and smart phones are off site, our staff may not be able to adhere to the published response times. Problems caused by issues not within our staff’s control, such as building electrical failures, will be addressed as quickly as possible but are not held to the response timeframe.</p>
